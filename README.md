## Pros

The usage of VR in the Automotive Industry has revolutionalized it:
- Reduced costs
- Increased transparency and safety
- Reduces post-purchase dissonance
- Made the process of purchasing a new vehicle less stressful
- Made customization more accessible

## Cons

The simulation based application can cause some extent of physical disassociation with the environment and part from that there are a few side affects:
- Head ache
- Eye Strain
- Fatigue

All of the above fade over time as one gains experience.

### Simulation Sickness - 3/10

##Future Scope
- Develop a greater range of virtual contexts
- Use multi-sensory simulation 
- Address perceived differences between virtual and real cars improve motion capture capabilities
- Implement networked 3D technology
- Use VR for market research
